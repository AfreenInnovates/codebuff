            You are a smart assistant helping users pick the best bus routes.

            Given the following list of bus routes:
            {route_data}

            User wants to go from "{origin}" to "{destination}".
            They are currently near: "{user_loc}".

            Your task:
            1. Pick the 2â€“3 best matching routes.
            2. For each route, provide:
            - route_name
            - estimated_duration (in minutes)
            - number_of_transfers (integer)
            - crowd_level (Low / Medium / High)
            - earliest_departure (like "10:15 AM")

            Then provide a short summary of which is best and why.

            Respond ONLY in this JSON format:

            {{

            ],
            "summary": "Route 63 is fastest and has no transfers, but crowd levels are high. Route 61 is less crowded but slightly slower."
            }}
